# 📗 data structures and algorithms in C

> learning C, one segfault at a time :3

## ✨ overview

my solutions to *Data Structures, Algorithms, and Software
Principles in C* by Thomas A. Standish.

i'm doing this to practice C and understand the inner workings of classic data
structures.

## 📁 layout

- `lib/` — code directly from the book
- `src/` — my solution by topic
- `bin/` — compiled binaries
- `doc/` — notes, if i actually remember to take any :')

## 🛠️ build & run

everything builds with `gcc` using the C99 standard. see `Makefile`.
